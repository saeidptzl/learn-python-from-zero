# Learn Python From Zero 🚀  
*A complete hands-on roadmap from beginner to advanced, built with projects.*

This repository contains my full Python learning journey — from absolute beginner concepts to advanced modules, web scraping, APIs, files, images, Flask, and data structures.  
Each topic includes notes, exercises, and **two real projects** that demonstrate what I've learned.

This repo is designed to be a **portfolio for employers** and a **personal learning track** for mastering Python step by step.
